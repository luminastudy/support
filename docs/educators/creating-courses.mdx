# Creating Courses

Learn how to create and publish courses on the Lumina Study platform.

## Prerequisites

Before creating a course, you need:

- **Public Git Repository** - GitHub, GitLab, or any public git source control (GitHub preferred)
- Course content prepared (syllabus, structure, materials)
- Understanding of block-based course structure

## Course Creation Process

### 1. Set Up Repository

Create a public git repository with the following structure:

```
my-course/
├── lumina.json
└── README.md
```

### 2. Define Block Structure

Add blocks to your `lumina.json`:

## Block Schema

<BlockSchemaDisplay />

## Publishing Workflow

### Git-Based Publishing

Lumina Study uses a git-based workflow:

1. **Create** your course repository (public GitHub repo recommended)
2. **Define** course structure in `lumina.json`
3. **Commit** your changes to git
4. **Push** to your public repository

### Automatic Updates

Once registered:

- Changes pushed to your repository automatically update the course
- Git commit history tracks all changes

## Best Practices

### Naming Conventions

- Use clear, descriptive block titles
- Be consistent with terminology
- Provide translations for all languages

### Course Structure

- Start with broad topics, drill down to specifics
- Limit depth to 3-4 levels for clarity
- Use prerequisites judiciously
- Group related content together

### Content Organization

- One concept per block
- Clear learning objectives for each block
- Link to external resources when appropriate
- Keep blocks focused and manageable
